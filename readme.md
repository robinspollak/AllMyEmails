#Words That People Email Me The Most
This is a project in which I scraped my past 8000 received emails and performed semantic analysis on them. For each email I broke down the subject lines and counted the appearances of each. I then rendered each keyword on the home page, allowing the user to click a work in order to see metadata about emails whose subject lines include that keyword.
